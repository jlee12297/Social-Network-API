# Social-Network-API
This Social Network API project provides users with data usable for a social media application, where users can share "thoughts", add friends, and react to other user's thoughts. This project was created using Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Moment for time formatting, and Insomnia to test the routes and provide the video walkthrough. Npm i to install all required dependencies (npm i mongoose manually if needed), and users should easily be able to test routes and post, update, and delete through insomnia.
